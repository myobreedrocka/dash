But what if you want to use iThenticate for free? And what if you want to check your graphics and illustrations created with CorelDRAW, a popular vector graphics editor? In this article, we will show you how to do both.
 
## How to Use iThenticate for Free
 
iThenticate is a subscription-based service that requires you to buy credits to check your documents. However, there are some ways to use it for free or at a lower cost.
 
- If you are a researcher or an author affiliated with an academic institution, you may be able to access iThenticate through your library or research office. Check with your institution if they have a license for iThenticate and how to use it.
- If you are a publisher or a journal editor, you may be able to join Crossref Similarity Check, a service that provides access to iThenticate at a discounted rate. Crossref Similarity Check is a partnership between iThenticate and Crossref, a non-profit organization that provides digital object identifiers (DOIs) and other services for scholarly publishing. To join Crossref Similarity Check, you need to be a Crossref member and deposit metadata and DOIs for your publications.

- If you are an individual user who wants to check your own work, you may be able to use iThenticate's Individual Edition. This is a limited version of iThenticate that allows you to check up to 50 documents per year for a one-time fee of $100. However, this option is only available for users in certain countries and regions.

## How to Check CorelDRAW Files with iThenticate
 
iThenticate can check various file formats, including Microsoft Word, PDF, HTML, and plain text. However, it cannot check CorelDRAW files (.cdr) directly. To check your graphics and illustrations created with CorelDRAW, you need to convert them into a compatible file format first.
